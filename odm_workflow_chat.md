## Person: 
- What is the best way to use open drone map for processing orthomosaics on the commandline"

## ChatGPT: 
- OpenDroneMap (ODM) is a powerful open-source tool that can process aerial imagery into orthomosaics, point clouds, 3D models, and more. To process orthomosaics using ODM on the command line, you'll need to follow these steps:
1. Install OpenDroneMap:

If you haven't already installed OpenDroneMap, you can download and install it by following the instructions in the official documentation: [https://docs.opendronemap.org/installation.html](https://docs.opendronemap.org/installation.html) 
1. Organize your images:

Create a new directory and place all the aerial images you want to process in that directory. Make sure the images have geotags (GPS data), as this information is crucial for generating accurate orthomosaics.

```bash

mkdir /path/to/project
cp /path/to/images/* /path/to/project
```


1. Run OpenDroneMap:

To run ODM on the command line, navigate to the directory where you installed OpenDroneMap and run the following command:

```bash

./run_odm.sh --project-path /path/to/project
```



Replace `/path/to/project` with the path to the directory you created in step 2.
1. Customize processing options:

OpenDroneMap has many options that you can tweak to customize the output. For example, if you want to generate an orthomosaic with a specific resolution, you can use the `--orthophoto-resolution` flag:

```css

./run_odm.sh --project-path /path/to/project --orthophoto-resolution 5
```



This command will generate an orthomosaic with a resolution of 5 cm/px. You can find more options in the official documentation: [https://docs.opendronemap.org/arguments.html](https://docs.opendronemap.org/arguments.html) 
1. Access the output:

After the processing is complete, you can find the generated orthomosaic in the following directory:

```bash

/path/to/project/odm_orthophoto/odm_orthophoto.tif
```



You can open this file in any GIS software, like QGIS or ArcGIS, for further analysis or visualization.

These steps outline the basic process for generating orthomosaics using OpenDroneMap on the command line. Depending on the size and complexity of your dataset, processing can take a while, so be patient.

## Person: 
- Make the resolution of the orthophoto 1.5.

## ChatGPT: 
- To generate an orthophoto with a resolution of 1.5 cm/px using OpenDroneMap, simply modify the `--orthophoto-resolution` flag in the command as follows:

```bash

./run_odm.sh --project-path /path/to/project --orthophoto-resolution 1.5
```



This command will process the images and generate an orthophoto with a resolution of 1.5 cm/px. Remember to replace `/path/to/project` with the path to the directory where you placed your aerial images.

## Person: 
- How can I incorporate RTK from a DJI drone and Ground Control Points?

## ChatGPT: 
- Incorporating RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) data from a DJI drone and Ground Control Points (GCPs) can significantly improve the accuracy of your orthomosaic generated with OpenDroneMap. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your GCPs:

Collect GCPs using a GNSS receiver or another accurate surveying method. Measure the coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevation) of each GCP and record them. Make sure that the GCPs are well-distributed throughout your project area for optimal results.
1. Create a GCP file:

Create a plain text file (e.g., `gcp_list.txt`) containing the GCP coordinates and their corresponding image coordinates. The file should follow this format:

```python

WGS84
gcp1_latitude gcp1_longitude gcp1_elevation pixel_x1 pixel_y1 image1.jpg
gcp1_latitude gcp1_longitude gcp1_elevation pixel_x2 pixel_y2 image2.jpg
...
gcp2_latitude gcp2_longitude gcp2_elevation pixel_x1 pixel_y1 image1.jpg
...
```



Each row represents a GCP with its geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, elevation) and its image coordinates (pixel_x, pixel_y) in one or more images where it's visible. The first line indicates the coordinate system being used (WGS84, in this case).
1. Geotag your images with RTK data:

DJI drones with RTK capabilities store precise geotag information in the image EXIF data. Make sure that your images have been geotagged with the RTK data. You can verify the geotags using an EXIF viewer or a GIS software.
1. Process images with OpenDroneMap:

Run OpenDroneMap with the `--gcp` flag to specify the GCP file you created in step 2. Also, include other desired options such as the orthophoto resolution. For example:

```bash

./run_odm.sh --project-path /path/to/project --gcp /path/to/gcp_list.txt --orthophoto-resolution 1.5
```



Replace `/path/to/project` with the path to the directory containing your images and `/path/to/gcp_list.txt` with the path to your GCP file.

OpenDroneMap will use the GCPs and the RTK geotags from your DJI drone to generate an accurate orthophoto. This process might take longer than processing without GCPs, but the resulting orthophoto should have improved positional accuracy.
